# Find-Job-App
- The JobFinder project focuses on developing a comprehensive job application system where users can register, log in, filter or search for suitable job listings, and manage their personal information, including work experience and education. Users can view a list of the jobs they've applied for on their profile page. Job listings display the opening date, and the number of applicants is updated after a user applies. Additionally, users can apply for certification programs offered by various companies.
- This application is developed using the Java, Java Swing and PostgreSql.
